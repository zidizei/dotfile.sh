#!/bin/bash
# **[dotfile.sh](https://github.com/zidizei/dotfile.sh/)** is a shell script to install
# (symlink) various collections of dotfiles onto your system.

#/
#/ Usage: dotfile.sh [<options>] [<dotfile...>]
#/
#/ The <dotfile...> is a space-separated list of dotfile collections that should be installed.
#/ If left out, all the dotfiles that can be found will be installed.
#/ Collections are found inside folders of the same name under your current working directory.
#/
#/ Options:
#/   -d,--debug          Passing the debug option will set the -x flag for bash.
#/   --preview           Don't actually install any dotfiles.
#/                       Pre/post hooks and backup creations are not going to be run as well.
#/   --linux             Explicitly install any dotfiles for Linux.
#/   --osx               Explicitly install any dotfiles for macOS.

# Refer to the [README](https://github.com/zidizei/dotfile.sh/blob/master/README.md) for more
# information about the usage and installation of **dotfile.sh**.

# **dotfiles** works by grouping up your various dotfiles (or any other configuration files, really) in
# folders, that are referred to as **collections**. For example, a collection for Vim configuration files
# could look like the following:
#â”œâ”€â”€ vimfiles/
#â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ vim/
#â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ INSTALL.sh
#â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ vimrc
# By running `dotfiles vimfiles`, the `vimrc` file would be symlinked to `$HOME/.vimrc`
# and the `vim` folder, which might contain all your plugins for Vim, will be symlinked to `$HOME/.vim`.
#
# Some collections might require some additional installation steps. These can be specified inside a
# `INSTALL.sh` file, where a `pre()` and/or `post()` function can defined. These hooks will then be called
# before and after the installation of the collection's dotfiles, respectively.
#
# It is also possible to tell **dotfile.sh** where the files and folders should be installed to
# by setting the `$TARGET` variable, which defaults to `$HOME`.
#
# In case there's already a dotfile or folder present, a backup is created.
#
# ## Backing up existing dotfiles
#
# Backups are created by appending ".backup" the original file's name.
function backupExistingDotfiles {

        mv $1 $1.backup
    }

    # If the file or folder in question already exists, we'll check whether a backup of it
    # already exists, as well.
    #
    # If that's the case, the user can decide between two options on how to proceed.
    # The first option is to not create a new backup. This means that the existing file or folder
    # will be **removed** and no new backup is created.
    #
    # The second option is to remove the existing backup instead, so a new
    # one can be created.

# with the `vimfiles` example.

# ## Symlinking a bundle of dotfiles
#
# The other way is to symlink to whole collection's folder to a specific target path.
# This is referred to as a **bundle** of dotfiles. Where exactly the folder
# should be symlinked to is specified by the `$TARGET` variable, which should be
# defined in the `INSTALL.sh` file.

# ## Collections
#
# The collections that are to be installed come from the command-line arguments.
# If none are specified, we'll install all the dotfiles we can find.
# Otherwise, the script checks if we can find a directory with the same name for each
# specified collection.

# file can be found.

    # `pre` and `post` hook functions, if they have been defined. Whether the dotfile collection
    # should be bundled is determined by the `INSTALL.sh`'s `$TARGET` variable. If it is set,
    # the collection will be installed as a bundle at the location specified by that variable.
    #
    # > **TODO:** Use another extra variable to determine the installation method, since there might
    # > be cases where someone would want to symlink individual dotfiles at a custom location.
    # > Right now, this only works for dotfiles and folders being symlinked to `$HOME`.
    #
    # If it is not set, the dotfiles are installed using individual symbolic links.
